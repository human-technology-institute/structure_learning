# Changelog

## Version 1.0.0

### General Updates
- Major code refactoring
- Integration with OPAD re-weighing scheme
- Integration with CPDAG analysis
- Integration with causal effects

### Experiment Class Enhancements
#### Experiment Configuration
- Added functionality to define experiments using various samplers and metrics 
without the explicit instantiation and handling of the specific classes
- Added functionality to export experiment configurations to YAML files using `exp.to_yaml()`.
- Enabled loading and running experiments directly from YAML files via `Experiment.from_yaml()`.

#### Evaluation Metrics
- Expanded evaluation metrics to include:
  - `mae` (Mean Absolute Error)
  - `mse` (Mean Squared Error)
  - `rhat` (Potential Scale Reduction Factor)
  - `kld` (Kullback-Leibler Divergence)
  - `jsd` (Jensen-Shannon Divergence)
- Improved plotting functionality for evaluation results, allowing better visualization of sampler performance.

### Sampler Updates
#### StructureMCMC Sampler
- Added configurations for `distribution`, `opad`, and `opad+` result types to support advanced result handling.
- Enhanced support for multiple chains and seeds, improving reproducibility and scalability.

#### PartitionMCMC Sampler
- Added configuration for `FULL` and `PC` search space
- Improved handling of DAG graph types for compatibility with new features.

#### Other Implemented Sampler Classes
- Introduced additional sampler classes to support diverse sampling strategies, including:
  - `HillClimb`
  - `PC`
- Enhanced flexibility in selecting samplers based on experiment requirements.

### Distribution Handling
#### True Distribution Computation
- Added functionality to compute true distributions using `Distribution.compute_distribution()`.
- Enhanced compatibility with various scoring methods, including `BGeScore`.

#### Plotting Enhancements
- Introduced `Distribution.plot_multiple()` for visualizing multiple distributions simultaneously.
- Improved plotting options for better clarity and customization.

### Causal Inference
#### Ability to Compute Causal Effects
- Implemented methods to compute causal effects between variables using learned structures.
- Added support for interventions in causal inference workflows.

### Incorporating Priors
#### Priors in Structure Learning
- Added functionality to include prior knowledge in structure learning processes.
- Supported priors for edge constraints

### Data Class Enhancements
#### Updates from `src/data/data.py`
- Added functionality to load datasets from various file formats, including `.csv` and `.npy`.
- Implemented methods for preprocessing data, such as normalization.
- Enhanced support for splitting datasets into training and testing subsets.
- Improved integration with scoring functions and graph structures for seamless experimentation.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with unsupported result types in samplers, ensuring compatibility with new configurations.
- Improved error handling in `Experiment.run()` to prevent crashes during execution.

### Code Refactoring
- Refactored methods across samplers and experiments to improve readability and maintainability.
- Optimized performance for large-scale experiments and sampling processes.
